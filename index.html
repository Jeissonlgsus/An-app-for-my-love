                            My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
                            Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
                            If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
                            If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
                            I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
                            But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
                            And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
                            Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
                            I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
                            That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>
                            I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br>
                            My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.<br>
                            And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
                            As any she belied with false compare.<br>
